### Activate Env

`source .venv/bin/activate`

### Run Baseline

```
export WANDB_MODE="online"
GPU=$(python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.device_count())")
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=$GPU train_gpt_adam.py --run_name "baseline_adamw"
```

## Code Style

### Pre-commit Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Install and use pre-commit hooks before any commit
- All code must pass pre-commit checks before commit
- Run `pre-commit install` after cloning the repository

### For Loops Must Not Nest More Than 3 Levels, Function Calls Must Not Recurse More Than 2 Levels

*The following part is primarily for AI Agent to understand our coding standards.*

### No Defensive Programming
- Avoid unnecessary safety checks and validations
- Let code fail fast when preconditions are not met. Let exceptions bubble up naturally when appropriate
- Use try-catch blocks sparingly, only when absolutely necessary
- **NEVER** use `dict.get()` with default values - use direct dictionary access: `config['key']`

### Self-Documenting Code Over Comments
- **Good code doesn't need comments** - if control flow is clear and variables are well-named, the code should be self-explanatory
- Reading the code should be easier than reading comments
- However, if your code is complex or unclear, comments are better than no documentation
- Prioritize: Clean Code > Commented Code > Uncommented Complex Code

### Minimize Code - Write Only What's Necessary to Complete the Task, Nothing More

### Import Organization
- **All imports must be placed at the beginning of the file** - imports are not allowed in the middle of code

### Ask User Before Execute
- AI-generated code is often low-quality and cannot be executed directly, so please ask the user before execution and only execute after the user agrees
- When you become confused or uncertain while coding, ask the user for guidance or which approach is better - don't just keep writing blindly

### Do Not Modify User's Code Without Permission
If you notice the latest code differs from the version in context (e.g., reverted or modified), it means the user has made changes or was unsatisfied with your code and undid it. Do NOT revert their changes or restore your previous code. Focus on the current task instead of arguing with the user.

### Reuse Before Reinvent
- Before implementing new functionality, always search the codebase for existing code that can be reused or adapted
- Avoid duplicating logic that already exists elsewhere in the repository

### When Uncertain, Ask First
- If you encounter something unclear or are unsure how to implement it, ask the user immediately - clarify everything before writing code

### No Fake Unit Tests
- Fake UTs are meaningless unit tests, typically falling into two categories: paranoid assertions that can never fail, and tautological assertions
- To identify tautological assertions: ask yourself, if I intentionally break the code, would this assertion catch it?

### Define Variables Close to Their Usage
- Variable definitions should be placed immediately before where they are used
- Avoid inserting unrelated code between a variable's definition and its usage

### Inline Single-Use Variables
- Variables used only once should be inlined, unless the variable name adds semantic clarity
- If the expression is complex or non-obvious, a descriptive variable name serves as self-documentation

### Examples

```python
# non-informative comment
# Compute metrics
metrics = {
    "l1_error": torch.mean(l1_error).item(),
    "l2_error": torch.mean(l2_error).item(),
    "l1_error_weighted": torch.mean(weighted_l1).item(),
    "l2_error_weighted": torch.mean(weighted_l2).item(),
    "num_frames": len(l1_error),
}

# non-informative comment
def clear_conversation(self):
    """Clear conversation history."""
    self.conversations = []

# wrong: too many checks
[arg for arg in sys.argv[2:] if "=" in arg]
# correct: simple and pop out error
sys.argv[2:]

# totally wrong: defense programming using wrong parameters and user doees not even know
if torch.distributed.is_initialized():
    world_size = torch.distributed.get_world_size()
else:
    world_size = 1

# wrong: too many checks and hide the error
# correct way: this if is necessary, del it
if arg.startswith("--") and i + 1 < len(sys.argv):
    key = arg[2:]  # 去掉 '--'
    value = sys.argv[i + 1]

# wrong: useless if, complex control flow
if i == j:
    distance_matrix[i, j] = 0.0
else:
    lev_distance = distance.Levenshtein.distance(texts[i], texts[j])
    max_len = max(len(texts[i]), len(texts[j]))
    similarity = 1.0 - (lev_distance / max_len) if max_len > 0 else 1.0
    distance_matrix[i, j] = similarity
    distance_matrix[j, i] = similarity
```
